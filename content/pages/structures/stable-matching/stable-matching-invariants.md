Stable Matching Invariants
--------------------------

We are interested in invariants of the Mating Ritual described in the Notes for finding stable marriages when there are an equal number of boys and girls. Let Angelina and Jen be two of the girls, and Keith and Tom be two of the boys.  
  

Which of the following predicates are **preserved invariants** of the Mating Ritual no matter what the preferences are among the boys and girls? (Remember that a predicate that is always false is a preserved invariant －check the definition to see why. Also, a preserved invariant doesn't need to be true initially, it just needs to _stay_ true once it _starts_ being true.)

Express your answer as a sequence of digits in increasing order separated by spaces, for example,

`1 4 5`

1.  Angelina is crossed off Tom's list, and she has a suitor that she prefers to Tom.
2.  Tom is serenading Jen.
3.  Tom is not serenading Jen.
4.  Tom's list of girls to serenade is empty.
5.  All the boys have the same number of girls left uncrossed in their lists.
6.  Jen is crossed off Keith's list, and Keith prefers Jen to anyone he is serenading.
7.  Jen is the only girl on Keith's list.
8.  Jen is crossed off Keith's list, and there is no set of stable marriages －not just the set produced by the Mating Ritual －in which Jen is married to Keith.
