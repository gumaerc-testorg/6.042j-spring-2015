Late For A Date
---------------

  

*   Sean and Jess have reservations at Trident at 10am. Sean is walking from Back Bay and Jess is taking the T from Central Square.
  
*   The T is unreliable, so Jess will arrive at some time between 9:50am and 10:10am (whole minutes only) with uniform probability.
  
*   On Sean's way to Trident, there are 10 stores that he likes. He will spend 1 minute in a given store independently with probability \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). If he doesn't visit any of the stores, he will arrive at Trident at 9:55am (if he goes to all of them, he will be 5 minutes late).
  
*   Their arrival times are independent.

Please answer in fractions of the form x/y.

1.  Let \\(J\\) be the random variable for Jess' minute of arrival. I.e. \\(J\\) gives values in \\(\[-10,10\]\\). What is the probability that Jess will be exactly on time (i.e. \\(\\Pr\[J=0\]\\))?

3.  Let \\(S\\) be the random variable for Sean's minute of arrival. I.e. \\(S\\) gives values in \\(\[-5,5\]\\). What is the probability that Sean will be exactly on time (i.e. \\(\\Pr\[S=0\]\\))?

5.  What is the probability that they will arrive at the same time?
