Inside the TA's brain
---------------------

Recent studies have shown that some small area in our brains is sensitive to _nonsensical structures_: the 1,000,000 neurons of that area seem to be firing whenever the individual is presented with such structures. This area is now known as the Grader's Area.

In a now famous series of experiments (Pseudoneurologica, 28(1):123-129, 1999), several 6.042 TAs have been presented with students' solutions to exam problems. On reading a solution, the _expected number_ of neurons to fire in the Grader's Area was estimated to be 550,000. Assume that this estimate is indeed correct.

Moreover, a TA realizes that a solution is _bad_ if the number of neurons in his/her Grader's Area that fire is greater than the number of neurons that do not by 200,000.

1.  What is the least number of neurons in the Grader's Area that must fire in order for the TA to realize that a solution is bad?
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
  
3.  With the information given, provide the best bound on the probability that the TA realizes a solution is bad. Please answer as a fraction of the form x/y.
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
  
5.  In a follow-up study the standard deviation of the number of neurons that fire on seeing a bad solution was found to be 25,000. Using this additional information, provide a better bound on the probability that the TA realizes a solution is bad. Please answer as a fraction of the form x/y.
