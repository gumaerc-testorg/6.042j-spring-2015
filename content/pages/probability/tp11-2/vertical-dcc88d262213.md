Socks And Shoes
---------------

  

Parker has two pairs of black shoes and three pairs of brown shoes. He also has three pairs of red socks, four pairs of brown socks and six pairs of black socks.

Now let's say that Parker chooses a pair of shoes at random and a pair of socks at random. We would like to know the probability of him choosing shoes and socks of the same color.

1.  **Identify the outcomes!** An outcome is \_\_\_\_\_.
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;a pair of shoesa pair of socksa pair of colorsall permutations of shoes and socksa color a pair of colors&nbsp;
    
  
3.  **Identify the event of interest!**
    
    *   How many outcomes are there in total?
        
        Exercise 2
        
        &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
        
      
    *   How many outcomes are there in the event of interest?
        
        Exercise 3
        
        &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
        
  
5.  **Assign outcome probabilities**
    
    Please answer in the form of decimals with four significant digits.

        &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
        
  
7.  **Compute event probabilities!**
    
    Please answer in the form of decimals with four significant digits.
    
    What is the probability that he chooses shoes and socks of the same color?
    
    Exercise 6
