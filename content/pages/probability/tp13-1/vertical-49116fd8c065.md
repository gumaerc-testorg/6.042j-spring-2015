Binomial Board Breaking
-----------------------

  

Bruce Lee is practicing his skills for an unreleased movie by breaking 5 boards with his fists.  
Assume he breaks a board with probability 0.8 (he is practicing his left fist; that's why the probability is not 1) and that he breaks each board independently.

1.  What is the probability that Bruce breaks exactly 2 out of the 5 boards that are placed before him? Please answer in the form of a decimal with four significant digits.
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
  
3.  What is the probability that Bruce breaks at most 3 out of the 5 boards that are placed before him? Please answer in the form of a decimal with five significant digits.
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
  
5.  What is the expected number of boards Bruce will break?
    
    Exercise 3
