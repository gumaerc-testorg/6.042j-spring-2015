6.042 TEAL Table
----------------

  

A 6.042 problem-solving team has 8 students (Alyssa, Ben, Carlos, ...) seated around a circular table. Since there are whiteboards all around, it doesn't matter which way students face, so two seatings are regarded as defining the same _arrangement_ if each student has the same student on their right in both seatings. We'll be interested in counting how many arrangements there are of these 8 students, given some restrictions. Either input the final result or an equivalent form, using fact(x) to denote \\(x!\\), explictly write out multiplication with \*, and \*\* for exponentiation.

1.  How many different arrangements of these 8 students around the table are there without any restrictions?

3.  How many arrangements of these 8 students are there with Alyssa sitting next to Ben?

5.  How many arrangements are there with Ben sitting next to both Alyssa AND Carlos?
