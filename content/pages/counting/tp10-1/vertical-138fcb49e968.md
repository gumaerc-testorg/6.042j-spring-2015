Pigeonhole Principle
--------------------

  

Below is a list of properties that a group of people might possess.

For each property, either give the minimum number of people that must be in a group to ensure that the property holds, or else write **nh** to indicate that the property need **n**ot **h**old even for arbitrarily large groups of people.

_Assume that every year has exactly 365 days; ignore leap years._
